With ELib, school staff can easily add books and other reading materials, while students can borrow and read them on their phones.\n\nThis app is built using two main technologies: Flutter and Laravel. Flutter helps make the app look nice and work smoothly on your phone, while Laravel handles all the behind-the-scenes stuff, like storing and organizing the books.\n\nBut that's not all! ELib also uses something called Pusher to make things happen in real-time. This means students can see updates instantly, like when a new book is added or when someone borrows a book.\n\nSo, whether you're looking for textbooks, novels, or research papers, ELib has got you covered, making reading and learning easier and more fun for everyone!\n\n# Screenshots\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;\">\n    <div style=\"flex: 0 0 33.33%; max-width: 33.33%; padding: 10px;\">\n        <img src=\"/assets/works/elib/home.webp\" alt=\"Home Screen\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"flex: 0 0 33.33%; max-width: 33.33%; padding: 10px;\">\n        <img src=\"/assets/works/elib/detail.webp\" alt=\"Detail Screen\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"flex: 0 0 33.33%; max-width: 33.33%; padding: 10px;\">\n        <img src=\"/assets/works/elib/read.webp\" alt=\"Reading Screen\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"flex: 0 0 33.33%; max-width: 33.33%; padding: 10px;\">\n        <img src=\"/assets/works/elib/filter.webp\" alt=\"Filter Books Screen\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"flex: 0 0 33.33%; max-width: 33.33%; padding: 10px;\">\n        <img src=\"/assets/works/elib/onread.webp\" alt=\"Currently Reading Screen\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"flex: 0 0 33.33%; max-width: 33.33%; padding: 10px;\">\n        <img src=\"/assets/works/elib/social.webp\" alt=\"User Search Screen\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"flex: 0 0 33.33%; max-width: 33.33%; padding: 10px;\">\n        <img src=\"/assets/works/elib/notification.webp\" alt=\"Notification Screen\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"flex: 0 0 33.33%; max-width: 33.33%; padding: 10px;\">\n        <img src=\"/assets/works/elib/settings.webp\" alt=\"Settings Screen\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n";
