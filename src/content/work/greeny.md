### Background

In response to the pressing need for sustainable agricultural practices, a team comprising myself and three friends - [Maulana Arif Wijaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maulana-arif), [Sely Ruli Amanda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sely-ruli-amanda-b2a25a1b3), and [Lailatul Badriyah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lailatulbadriyah) - embarked on a project aimed at revolutionizing farming techniques. Our motivation stems from the desire to address the challenges faced by farmers, including disease detection, soil classification, and access to markets. Leveraging technology, we aim to empower farmers and enhance productivity.

### Short Overview

Our project seeks to integrate various technological solutions to streamline urban agricultural processes. With a focus on innovation, we aim to create a comprehensive platform that addresses key challenges faced by urban farmers, including disease detection, soil analysis, and market accessibility. By harnessing the power of augmented reality (AR) and user interactive animations, our solution aims to provide urban farmers with real-time insights and actionable recommendations, thereby revolutionizing traditional farming practices.

### Competition Focus

This project is developed specifically for a competition where teams are challenged to devise innovative solutions to address agricultural issues. Our team, comprising myself and my friends, is committed to presenting a comprehensive solution that combines advanced technologies with agricultural expertise to tackle pressing challenges in the farming sector.

### My Key Roles

##### **1. Disease Detection**
Implemented robust disease detection algorithms using machine learning to accurately identify plant diseases based on image inputs. Achieved high accuracy rates and optimized models for real-time processing.

##### **2. Soil Classification**
Developed a soil classification system utilizing machine learning techniques to classify soil types based on various parameters.

##### **3. Virtual Plotting with AR**
Did the development of a virtual plotting feature using augmented reality (AR) technology. Enabled users to visualize and plan their agricultural plots virtually, enhancing efficiency and reducing resource wastage.

##### **4. Marketplace Payment Integration**
Integrated secure payment gateways into the marketplace platform, ensuring seamless transactions for buyers and sellers. Implemented robust security measures to protect user data and financial transactions.

##### **5. User Interactive Animation**
Designed and implemented user interactive animations to enhance user experience and engagement. Utilized modern animation techniques to create intuitive interfaces and improve usability.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, our project represents a collaborative effort to revolutionize farming practices through technological innovation. With a focus on addressing key challenges faced by urban farmers, including disease detection, soil classification, and market accessibility, we aim to empower agricultural communities and foster sustainable growth in the farming sector.
