## Mangkat

In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, public transportation, particularly city buses (locally known as "angkot"), plays a crucial role in urban mobility. While these buses maintain fixed routes, the demand for public transportation on other routes often surges. This imbalance between supply and demand poses a significant challenge in angkot services.

Addressing this issue is the core idea behind the development of Mangkat application. Mangkat aims to bring significant impact, including enhancing public transportation accessibility for communities and optimizing public transportation management. With Mangkat, achieving a balance between supply and demand within the angkot system becomes possible, leading to positive outcomes such as reduced traffic congestion and air pollution. Mangkat also serves as a solution for transportation authorities by enhancing supervision and coordination in public transportation operations, benefiting both passengers and city transportation managers.

#### Background

As technology advances, public transportation becomes a vital aspect of urban mobility. One common form of public transportation used is city buses ("angkot"), which typically operate on fixed routes. However, the demand for public transportation on other routes often increases, leading to a significant mismatch between supply and demand in angkot services.
****
The mismatch between supply and demand in angkot services is a major hurdle in many cities' angkot management. Prospective passengers often face obstacles as some buses are overcrowded while others operate well below their maximum capacity, resulting in losses for angkot drivers. In the digital era, efficient solutions are needed to address issues related to angkot management.

In its heyday, the number of angkot fleets in Malang City was substantial. However, it has now dwindled to less than 50% of active operation. Data from the Malang City Transportation Agency shows that there are currently 525 angkot units serving 16 routes. Despite the significant fleet size, the imbalance in route usage and management remains a challenge.

#### Solution: Mangkat Application

To tackle these challenges, a more sophisticated solution connected with technology is needed to optimize the usage of existing fleets. This is where Mangkat, an Android-based mobile application, comes into play. Mangkat is an innovative application designed to address angkot management issues. The application allows the Malang City Transportation Agency (Dishub) to control and manage angkot more efficiently based on real-time traffic data and passenger demand. With Mangkat, Dishub can adjust angkot routes according to passenger demand and traffic density accurately, thus improving the efficiency of existing fleet usage.

#### Conclusion

Mangkat aims to create a more efficient transportation system in line with current technological advancements. This will contribute positively to the quality of life for city residents, minimize passenger wait times, and enhance urban mobility productivity. Moreover, Mangkat opens up new opportunities for utilizing data in better transportation planning for the future.
