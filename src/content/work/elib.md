#### Overview

ELib is an electronic library app made especially for schools and campuses. It's like having a library right in your pocket! With ELib, school staff can easily add books and other reading materials, while students can borrow and read them on their phones.

This app is built using two main technologies: Flutter and Laravel. Flutter helps make the app look nice and work smoothly on your phone, while Laravel handles all the behind-the-scenes stuff, like storing and organizing the books.

But that's not all! ELib also uses something called Pusher to make things happen in real-time. This means students can see updates instantly, like when a new book is added or when someone borrows a book.

So, whether you're looking for textbooks, novels, or research papers, ELib has got you covered, making reading and learning easier and more fun for everyone!
